                          Patiently waiting; the bow at his feet.<br>
                          <br>
                          Taxis hurtle past<br>
                          Bata batas beep beep<br>
                          A cacophony of sound<br>
                          And him an island; in the street<br>
                          <br>
                          Trucks rumble by <br>
                          The whoosh of air <br>
                          Lifting his hat; he turns the sound<br>
                          But who to greet?<br>
                          <br>
                          Smells of spices , stink of diesel,<br>
                          Hot rain bulleting<br>
                          on corrugated routs<br>
                          he sits; listening to the beat, the street.<br>
                          <br>
                          Waiting for a word,<br>
                          A touch , a coin in his bowl<br>
                          A moment of connection<br>
                          With another soul<br>
                          <br>
