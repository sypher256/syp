     <h6 class="heading">Software Development Quotes</6>
     <p class="quotes">
         Software is like sex: it’s better when it’s free.<br>
         If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likable person.<br>
         Quality is a product of a conflict between programmers and testers.<br>
         Everybody should learn to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.<br>
         I taught myself how to program computers when I was a kid, bought my first computer when I was 10, and sold my first commercial program when I was 12. <br>
         Software and cathedrals are much the same — first we build them, then we pray.<br>
         Web development is difficult, only then it is fun to do. You just have to set your standards. If it were to be easy, would anyone do it?.<br>
